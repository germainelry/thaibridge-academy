   - Click "Our Instructors" → Should go to `/about` and scroll to instructors section
   - Click "Student Reviews" → Should go to `/reviews`

### ✅ FAQ Quick Links Tests

**Test these cards in the FAQ page:**

- Click "View Our Courses" card → Should go to `/courses`
- Click "Student Reviews" card → Should go to `/reviews`
- Click "About Us" card → Should go to `/about`

### ✅ Hash Navigation Tests

**Test direct URL navigation:**

- Go to `/about#instructors` → Should scroll to instructors section
- Go to `/policy#privacy` → Should scroll to Privacy Policy section
- Go to `/policy#terms` → Should scroll to Terms of Service section
- Go to `/policy#refund` → Should scroll to Refund Policy section

### ✅ Expected Behavior

**What should happen:**

1. **Same Page Navigation:** Smooth scroll to the target section
2. **Cross-Page Navigation:** Navigate to the page and then scroll to the section
3. **Smooth Scrolling:** All scrolling should be smooth with proper offset for the fixed header
4. **Mobile Responsive:** Proper scroll offsets on mobile devices

### 🐛 If Navigation Doesn't Work

**Check these:**

1. Open browser developer tools and check for console errors
2. Verify the target section has the correct ID:
   - About page: `id="instructors"`
   - Policy page: `id="privacy"`, `id="terms"`, `id="refund"`
3. Check that the scroll offset accounts for the fixed header
4. Ensure the NavigationProvider is properly wrapped around the app
